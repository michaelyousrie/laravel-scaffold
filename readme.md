# What is this?
This is a set of classes and helpers to offer a standard API for some of the most common functionality I use in my Laravel applications.

It includes some helper api responses, unified date/time formats controlled globally and base repository/services to enforce and support the common repoistory and service patterns.

Also it ships with a basic user groups and permissions with the necessary User class and the middleware to make everything just work out of the box.

# Why is this a thing?
Because I found myself mostly repeating some of the functionality in most of my APIs. It's about time to unify all of that repeated code into an updateable manageable composer package yeah?

# NOTE
- This package uses some static files which can be found on:
